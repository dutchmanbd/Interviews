    "answer" : "The data can be passed between many services and activities using the following data types:\n\n– Primitive Data Types: This is used to share the activities and services of an application by using the command as Intent.putExtras(). This primitive data passes the command to show the persistent data using the storage mechanism. These are inbuilt data types that are used with the program. They provide a simple implementation of the type and easy to use commands.\n\n– Non-Persistent Objects: It is used to share complex and non-persistent objects. These are user-defined data types that are used for short duration and are also recommended to be used. These types of objects allow the data to be unique but it creates a complex system and increases the delay."
